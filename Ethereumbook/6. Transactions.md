## Structure of a transaction
A transaction is a serialized binary message that contains the following data:
- Nonce - sequence number, prevent message replay
- Gas Price - amount of ether (in wei) the msg.sender is willing to pay
- Gas Limit - maximum amount of gas the msg.sender is willing to buy
- Recipient - destination ETH address
- Value - amount of ether (in wei) to send to the destination
- Data - variable length binary data payload
- v,r,s - 3 componenets of an ECDSA digital signature of the originating EOA

## Transaction Nonce
Nonce makes sure which transaction comes first, and makes it unreplicatable by other accounts since the Nonce only has meaning under the context of the sending address.

##### Keeping Track of Nonces
Let’s look at an example:

>**web3.eth.getTransactionCount("0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f", \
"pending")**
40
> **web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: web3.eth.accounts[0], to: \
"0xB0920c523d582040f2BCB1bD7FB1c7C1ECEbdB34", value: web3.utils.toWei(0.01, "ether")});**
> **web3.eth.getTransactionCount("0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f", \
"pending")**
41
> **web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: web3.eth.accounts[0], to: \
"0xB0920c523d582040f2BCB1bD7FB1c7C1ECEbdB34", value: web3.utils.toWei(0.01, "ether")});**
> **web3.eth.getTransactionCount("0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f", \
"pending")**
41
> **web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: web3.eth.accounts[0], to: \
"0xB0920c523d582040f2BCB1bD7FB1c7C1ECEbdB34", value: web3.utils.toWei(0.01, "ether")});**
> **web3.eth.getTransactionCount("0x9e713963a92c02317a681b9bb3065a8249de124f", \
"pending")**
41

This let's us chack the transaction count.

1st transaction sent increase the transaction count to 41, and its pending. Even after adding more transactions, the `getTransactionCount` didn't call them.

##### Gaps in Nonces, Duplicate Nonces, and Confirmation
Transmit a transaction with Nonce 0  and another with Nonce 2, the 2nd one will not be included in any blocks and be stored in the mempool, while the ETH network waits for the missing nonce to appear.

All nodes would assume the missing nonce has been delayed and that transaction with nonce 2 was received out of sequence. Once nonce 1 is filled, all will be processed and included if valid, and impossible to be "recalled".

If we accidentally duplicate a nonce, transmitting 2 transactions with the same nonce with different recipients or values, one will be confirmed and the other rejected, and this is random.

##### Concurrency, Transaction Origination, and Nonces
Concurrency is when we have simultaneous computations by multiple independant systems. Can be in the same program, same CPU different pc etc via multithreading, multiprocessing and distrubuted systems.

Ethereum is a system that allows concurrency of operations (nodes, clients, DApps) but enforces a singleton state through consensus.

Concurrency is a problem, where each solution seems like a bottleneck, with attempts at creating a point of failure to chain the transaction process or queing them to a single node.

## Transaction Gas
The fuel of Ethereum, a virtual currency with its own exchange rate against ether.

Gas protect the system from volatility with the rapid changes in the value of ether, and manages the sensitive ratios between cost of resources the gas pays for like computation, memory and storage.

[ETH Gas Station](https://ethgasstation.info/) provides information on the current prices of gas

There's options for faster transactions with higher gas prices.

`gasLimit` gives the max number of units of gas the transaction originator is willing to buy in order to complete the transaction. So if the gas amount needed is fixed at 21,000 gas units, the total cost of ether for the gas would be 21,000 x (gasPrice you're willing to pay).

If the transaction is to a contract, the gas amount cannot be determined with accuracy due to the dependance on the contracts function may vary from each other.

`gasLimit` is the fuel tank capacity, car is the transaction, you can fill in as much gas for the computation needed to validate the transaction. But the road ahead has unpredictable events, thus the gas cost might be different than expected.

You are also paying after the transaction, and u need to have enough of the predicted gas already in your wallet.

## Transaction Recipient
Can be an EOA or a contract.

Sending ether to a wrong address will "burn" the ether, rendering it forever inaccessible. Few valid reasons for buring ether is to demotivate cheating in payment channels and other smart contracts, also the burned ether is distributed to all ether holders in proportion to their already held ether.

## Transaction Value and Data
Each transaction needs at least one or both, and never none.

Transaction with only value = `Payment` 
Transaction with only data = `Invocation`
Transaction with both value and data = `Payment and Invocation`

##### Transmitting Value to EOAs and Contracts
A state change is recorded for each transaction if the destination address is an EOA. 

If the destination is a contract, the EVM executes the contract and call the function named in the data payload of your transaction. If theres no data, the EVM will call a `fallback` function, and if its payable, will execute it to determine what to do next. Reverted if there's no fallback function or non-payable fallback function.

##### Transmitting a Data Payload to an EOA or Contract
When the transaction contains data, it's likely addressed to a contract. Data can still be sent to an EOA, but gets ignored, in the future it might change.

Data sent to a contract via a transaction will be interpreted by the EVM as a `contract invocation`.  Most contracts use this data as a `function invocation`, calling the named function and passing any encoded arguments to the function.

The data payload sent to an ABI-compatible contract is a hex serialized encoding of:

##### Function Selector
First  4 bytes of the Keccak-256 hash of the function's prototype, allowing the contract to unambiguously identify which function we wish to invoke.

##### Function Arguments
```sol
function withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {
	...
}
```
Argument is `withdraw_amount`, a `uint`.


Let’s calculate the Keccak-256 hash of this string:

> **web3.utils.sha3("withdraw(uint256)");**
'0x2e1a7d4d13322e7b96f9a57413e1525c250fb7a9021cf91d1540d5b69f16a49f'

The first 4 bytes of the hash are 0x2e1a7d4d. That’s our "function selector" value, which will tell the contract which function we want to call.

Next, let’s calculate a value to pass as the argument withdraw_amount. We want to withdraw 0.01 ether. Let’s encode that to a hex-serialized big-endian unsigned 256-bit integer, denominated in wei:

> **withdraw_amount = web3.utils.toWei(0.01, "ether");**
'10000000000000000'
> **withdraw_amount_hex = web3.utils.toHex(withdraw_amount);**
'0x2386f26fc10000'

Now, we add the function selector to the amount (padded to 32 bytes):

```2e1a7d4d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002386f26fc10000```


That’s the data payload for our transaction, invoking the withdraw function and requesting 0.01 ether as the withdraw_amount.

## Special Transaction: Contract Creation
There's a special case where a transaction creates a new contract on the blockchain, deploying for future use.

Contract creation transactions are sent to the `zero address` to create the contract.

When the `zero address` receive payments, the ether is burned and never recovered.

Contract creation transactions only contain a data payload that contains the compiled bytecode used for the created contract. This will only create the contract.

We can include an ether amount in the value field to provide the new contract with a starting balance, which is optional. But if you send ether to the contract creation address without a data payload (no contract), the ether sent is burned.

The contract needs to be compiled into a bytecode representation. This can be done with the Solidity compiler:

$ **solc --bin Faucet.sol**

Binary:
6060604052341561000f57600080fd5b60e58061001d6000396000f30060606040526004361060...

The same information can also be obtained from the Remix online compiler.

Now we can create the transaction:

> **src = web3.eth.accounts[0];**
> **faucet_code = \
  "0x6060604052341561000f57600080fd5b60e58061001d6000396000f300606...f0029";**
> **web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: src, to: 0, data: faucet_code, \
  gas: 113558, gasPrice: 200000000000});**

"0x7bcc327ae5d369f75b98c0d59037eec41d44dfae75447fd753d9f2db9439124b"

It is good practice to always specify a to parameter, even in the case of zero-address contract creation, because the cost of accidentally sending your ether to 0x0 and losing it forever is too great. You should also specify a gasPrice and gasLimit.

We can look at the receipt of the transaction to get information about the contract:

> **web3.eth.getTransactionReceipt( \
  "0x7bcc327ae5d369f75b98c0d59037eec41d44dfae75447fd753d9f2db9439124b");**

{
  blockHash: "0x6fa7d8bf982490de6246875deb2c21e5f3665b4422089c060138fc3907a95bb2",
  blockNumber: 3105256,
  contractAddress: "0xb226270965b43373e98ffc6e2c7693c17e2cf40b",
  cumulativeGasUsed: 113558,
  from: "0x2a966a87db5913c1b22a59b0d8a11cc51c167a89",
  gasUsed: 113558,
  logs: [],
  logsBloom: \
    "0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000...00000",
  status: "0x1",
  to: null,
  transactionHash: \
    "0x7bcc327ae5d369f75b98c0d59037eec41d44dfae75447fd753d9f2db9439124b",
  transactionIndex: 0
}

This includes the address of the contract, which we can use to send funds to and receive funds from the contract as shown in the previous section:

> **contract_address = "0xb226270965b43373e98ffc6e2c7693c17e2cf40b"**
> **web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: src, to: contract_address, \
  value: web3.utils.toWei(0.1, "ether"), data: ""});**

"0x6ebf2e1fe95cc9c1fe2e1a0dc45678ccd127d374fdf145c5c8e6cd4ea2e6ca9f"

> **web3.eth.sendTransaction({from: src, to: contract_address, value: 0, data: \
  "0x2e1a7d4d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000002386f26fc10000"});**

"0x59836029e7ce43e92daf84313816ca31420a76a9a571b69e31ec4bf4b37cd16e"

After a while, both transactions are visible on Etherscan, as shown in [Etherscan showing the transactions for sending and receiving funds](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/06transactions.asciidoc#publish_contract_transactions).

## Digital Signature
The digital signature:
1. Proves that the owner of the private key authorized the spending of ether or execution of a contract.
2. Guarantees `non-repudiation`: proof of authorization is undeniable.
3. Proves the transaction data has not been and can't be modified by anyone after the transaction is signed.

##### How Digital Signatures Work?
Digital Signatures are a math scheme with 2 parts, first is an algorithm for creating a signature using a private key (signing key), from a message (the transaction). Then the second part is an algorithm that allows anyone to verify the signature by only using the message and a public key.

Math of this is complicated, if I ever need to revisit:

## Separating Signing and Transmission (Offline Signing)
The three steps of creating, signing, and broadcasting a transaction normally happen as a single operation, for example using `web3.eth.sendTransaction`.![Offline signing of Ethereum transactions](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/raw/develop/images/offline_signing.png)
### Multiple-Signature (Multisig) Transactions

If you are familiar with Bitcoin’s scripting capabilities, you know that it is possible to create a Bitcoin multisig account which can only spend funds when multiple parties sign the transaction (e.g., 2 of 2 or 3 of 4 signatures). Ethereum’s basic EOA value transactions have no provisions for multiple signatures; however, arbitrary signing restrictions can be enforced by smart contracts with any conditions you can think of, to handle the transfer of ether and tokens alike.

To take advantage of this capability, ether has to be transferred to a "wallet contract" that is programmed with the spending rules desired, such as multisignature requirements or spending limits (or combinations of the two). The wallet contract then sends the funds when prompted by an authorized EOA once the spending conditions have been satisfied. For example, to protect your ether under a multisig condition, transfer the ether to a multisig contract. Whenever you want to send funds to another account, all the required users will need to send transactions to the contract using a regular wallet app, effectively authorizing the contract to perform the final transaction.

These contracts can also be designed to require multiple signatures before executing local code or to trigger other contracts. The security of the scheme is ultimately determined by the multisig contract code.

The ability to implement multisignature transactions as a smart contract demonstrates the flexiblity of Ethereum. However, it is a double-edged sword, as the extra flexibility can lead to bugs that undermine the security of multisignature schemes. There are, in fact, a number of proposals to create a multisignature command in the EVM that removes the need for smart contracts, at least for the simple M-of-N multisignature schemes. This would be equivalent to Bitcoin’s multisignature system, which is part of the core consensus rules and has proven to be robust and secure.
