(I will only note stuff that I don't currently know)

ERC-1155 is semi fungible, we can research this ourselves.

Each token has a token ID and a token URI.

A token URI is like an API call, with certain info associated with it.

The asset itself is not stored on the blockchain, instead on 3rd party data storage places like IPFS.
