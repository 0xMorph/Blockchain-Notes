## The Ethereum Virtual Machine
EVM is part of Ethereum that handles smart contract deployment and execution. Simple value transfer transactions between EOAs don't need to invoke it, but everything with a state update is computed by the EVM.

All execution processes are limited to a finite number of computational steps by the amount of gas available for any given smart contract execution.

EVM has several addressable data components like:
- An immutable program code ROM, loaded with bytecode of contracts to be executed
- volatile MEMORY, with location explicitly initialized to zero
- permanent STORAGE, part of Ethereum state, also zero-initialized

There is also a set of environment variables and data that is available during execution.
![The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) Architecture and Execution Context](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/raw/develop/images/evm-architecture.png)
^EVM architecture and execution context

EVM is just a computation engine with no scheduling capability, single threaded, like JS. No "system interfaces" or hardware support, completely virtual.

## EVM Instruction Set(Bytecode Operations)
The EVM instruction set offers most of the operations you might expect, including:
-   Arithmetic and bitwise logic operations
-   Execution context inquiries
-   Stack, memory, and storage access
-   Control flow operations
-   Logging, calling, and other operators

Also has access to account info like `address and balance` and block info along with current gas price.

Available `opcodes` can be divided to the following:

##### Arithmetic Operations
```
ADD        //Add the top two stack items
MUL        //Multiply the top two stack items
SUB        //Subtract the top two stack items
DIV        //Integer division
SDIV       //Signed integer division
MOD        //Modulo (remainder) operation
SMOD       //Signed modulo operation
ADDMOD     //Addition modulo any number
MULMOD     //Multiplication modulo any number
EXP        //Exponential operation
SIGNEXTEND //Extend the length of a two's complement signed integer
SHA3       //Compute the Keccak-256 hash of a block of memory
```

All arithmetic is performed modulo 2^256 (unless otherwise noted), and that the zeroth power of zero, 0^0, is taken to be 1.

##### Stack Operations
```

SSTORE  //Save a word to storage
MSIZE   //Get the size of the active memory in bytes
PUSHx   //Place x byte item on the stack, where x can be any integer 
          from 1 to 32 (full word) inclusive
DUPx    //Duplicate the x-th stack item, where x can be any integer 
          from 1 to 16 inclusive

## Ethereum State
EVM's job is to update the Ethereum state by computing valid state transitions from smart contract code execution.

At the top, we have Ethereum `world state`, a mapping of Ethereum addresses to accounts. At the lower level, each Ethereum address represents an  account comprising an ether balance, a nonce, account's storage and accounts program code. While for contracts is will contain all, for EOAs theres no code and empty storage.

When a transaction results in smart contract code execution, an EVM is initiated with an info required in relation to teh current creation of the block with the specific transaction being processed. The EVM's program code ROM is loaded with the code of the contract account being called, the program counter is set to zero, the storage is loaded form the contract's account storage and memory set to zero, all the blocks and env variables are set. Key variable is gas supply for this execution, which is set to the amount of gas paid by the msg.sender at the start of the transaction. As code execution progresses, gas supply is reduced according to the gas cost of the operations executed. If gas supply is zero we can "OOG" (out of gas) exception, execution halts and transaction is abandoned. No changes to the blockchain except the sender's nonce increased and their ether balance going down to pay the block's beneficiary for the resources used to execute the code to its halting point. 

The EVM running on a sandboxed copy of the Ethereum world state, with the sandboxed version being discarded completely if execution cannot complete. If execution completes, the real world state is updated to match the sandboxed version, including changes to contract's storage, new contracts created and any ether balance transfers initiated.

## Compiling Solidity to EVM Bytecode
Can use Remix, here we try to use the solc executable at cmd.

`$ solc --help`

Generating raw opcode with `--opcodes` option, to get full info use `--asm` but opcodes is sufficient. Let's compile example.sol and send the opcode outpout to a directory named BytecodeDir
`$ solc -o BytecodeDir --opcodes Example.sol`

or:

`$ solc -o BytecodeDir --asm Example.sol`

This will produce bytecode binary:

`$ solc -o BytecodeDir --bin Example.sol`

Output opcode files depend on the contracts contained within a Solidity file, in our Example.sol we only have one:

```sol
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

contract example {

  address contractOwner;

  function example() {
    contractOwner = msg.sender;
  }
}
```
Only 1 persistent state variable, which sets the address of the last account to run this countract.

The example.opcode file is like this, containing the EVM opcode instructions.

```sol
PUSH1 0x60 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE ISZERO PUSH1 0xE JUMPI PUSH1 0x0 DUP1
REVERT JUMPDEST CALLER PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 PUSH2 0x100 EXP DUP2 SLOAD DUP2 PUSH20
0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF MUL NOT AND SWAP1 DUP4 PUSH20
0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF AND MUL OR SWAP1 SSTORE POP PUSH1
0x35 DUP1 PUSH1 0x5B PUSH1 0x0 CODECOPY PUSH1 0x0 RETURN STOP PUSH1 0x60 PUSH1
0x40 MSTORE PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT STOP LOG1 PUSH6 0x627A7A723058 KECCAK256 JUMP
0xb9 SWAP14 0xcb 0x1e 0xdd RETURNDATACOPY 0xec 0xe0 0x1f 0x27 0xc9 PUSH5
0x9C5ABCC14A NUMBER 0x5e INVALID EXTCODESIZE 0xdb 0xcf EXTCODESIZE 0x27
EXTCODESIZE 0xe2 0xb8 SWAP10 0xed 0x
```

Compiling with asm gives a file named `example.evm` containing high level description of EVM bytecode instructions with helpful annotations:

```sol
/* "Example.sol":26:132  contract example {... */
  mstore(0x40, 0x60)
    /* "Example.sol":74:130  function example() {... */

}
```
`--bin-runtime` option gives machine readable hexadecimal bytecode:
```

```

You can investigate what’s going on here in detail using the opcode list given in [The EVM Instruction Set (Bytecode Operations)](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/13evm.asciidoc#evm_bytecode_overview).

Examining the first four instructions:

`PUSH1 0x60 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE`

PUSH1 followed by raw byte of 0x60. This instruction takes the single byte following the opcode in the program code and pushes it onto the stack. Possible tp push value of size up to 32 bytes onto the stack, as in:

`PUSH32 0x436f6e67726174756c6174696f6e732120536f6f6e20746f206d617374657221`

2nd PUSH1 opcode from `example.opcode` stores 0x40 on the top of the stack (pushing 0x60 down one slot).

Next is `MSTORE`, a memory state operation that stores a value to the EVM's memory. It takes 2 arguments and like most EVM operations, obtains them from the stack. For each argument the stack is "popped" ie the top value on the stack is taken off and all other values on the stack are shifted up one position. The 1st argument for `MSTORE` is the address of the word in memory where the value to be saved will be put. For this program we have 0x40 on top of the stack so that is removed now and used as the memory address. 2nd argument is the value to be saved which is 0x60 at the memory location 0x40.

Next opcode is `CALLVALUE`, an environmental opcode that pushes on top of the stack the amount of ether in wei sent with the message call that initiated this execution. We learn more on this later.

## Contract Deployment Code
There are differences between creating and deploying a new contract on the Ethereum platform and the code of the contract itself.

To create a new contract, special transaction to 0x0000000 address is needed and the data field is set to the contract's initiation code. When this transaction is processed, the code for the new contract account is NOT the code in the data field of the transaction. Instead, an EVM is instantiated with the code in the data field of the transaction loaded into its program code ROM, then the output of the execution of that DEVELOPMENT code is taken as code for the new contract account. Thats so new contracts can be programmatically initialized using the Ethereum world state at the time of deployment, setting values in the contract's storage and even sending ether or creating further contracts.

When compiling a contract offline, like using solc on cmd, we can get deployment bytecode or runtime bytecode.

The deployment bytecode is used for every aspect of initialization of a new contract account, including the bytecode that will end up being executed when transactions call this new contract(the runtime bytecode) and the code to initialize everything based on the contract's constructor.

Runtime bytecode is exactly the bytecode that ends up being executed when the new contract is being called, and nothing more, does not include the bytecode needed to initialize the contract during deployment.

Example, using our simple `Faucet.sol` contract:
```sol
// Version of Solidity compiler this program was written for
pragma solidity ^0.4.19;

// Our first contract is a faucet!
contract Faucet {

  // Give out ether to anyone who asks
  function withdraw(uint withdraw_amount) public {

      // Limit withdrawal amount
      require(withdraw_amount <= 100000000000000000);

      // Send the amount to the address that requested it
      msg.sender.transfer(withdraw_amount);
    }

  // Accept any incoming amount
  function () external payable {}

}
```
To get the deployment bytecode, `solc --bin Faucet.sol`, for runtime bytecode, `solc --bin-runtime Faucet.sol`.

Runtime bytecode is a subset of deployment bytecode, being contained entirely within the deployment bytecode

## Disassembling the Bytecode
Few tools for this, good way to understand how high-level Solidity acts in the EVM.

-   [_Porosity_](https://github.com/comaeio/porosity) is a popular open source decompiler.
    
-   [_Ethersplay_](https://github.com/trailofbits/ethersplay) is an EVM plug-in for Binary Ninja, a disassembler.
    
-   [_IDA-Evm_](https://github.com/trailofbits/ida-evm) is an EVM plugin for IDA, another disassembler.

We use Ethersplay here, might buy Binary Ninja soon. After feeding our Faucet.sol after loading the Ethersplay plugin.

![Faucet.sol runtime bytecode disassembled](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/raw/develop/images/Faucet_disassembled.png)

When u send a transaction to an ABI-compatible smart contract, can assume all contracts are, the transaction first interacts with that smart contract's `dispatcher`. The dispatcher reads in the data field of the transaction and sends the relevant part to the appropriate function. An example of a dispatcher is at the beginning of our disassembled `Faucet.sol` runtime bytecode. After the familiar `MSTORE` instruction, we see the following instructions:
```
PUSH1 0x4
CALLDATASIZE
LT
PUSH1 0x3f
JUMPI
```
Push1 pushed 0x4 to the top, which is otherwise currently empty, `CALLDATASIZE` gets the size in bytes of the data sent with the transaction(aka `calldata`) and pushes that number onto the stack. After everything, the stack looks like this:
``````
|-----------------------------|
|Stack                        | 
|-----------------------------|
|<length of calldata from tx> | 
|-----------------------------|
|0x4                          |
|-----------------------------|
``````

Next is `LT` short for "less than". Checks whether the top item on the stack is less than the next item, in our case it checks to see if the result of `CALLDATASIZE`is less than 4 bytes.

It checks that calldata is at least 4 bytes since thats how function identifiers work, each function is identified by its first 4 bytes of its `Keccak-256 hash`. Placing the function's name and what arguments it takes to that hash allows us to deduce its function identifier, in that case, we have: 
`keccak256("withdraw(uint256)") = 0x2e1a7d4d...`

Therefore the function identifier for the `withdraw(uint256)` function is 0x2e1a7d4d, since they are the first 4 bytes of the resulting hash. Function identifier is always 4 bytes long, so if the entire data field of the transaction sent to the contract is less than 4 bytes, there's no function which the transaction could possibly be contacting, UNLESS `fallback` function is defined. EVM jumped to fallback if the calldata length is less than 4 bytes.

`LT`pops the top 2 values of the stack and, if the transaction data field is less than 4 bytes, pushes 1 onto it. Otherwise, it pushes 0, in our example, lets assume the datafield of the transaction sent to our countract was less than 4 bytes.

With `PUSH1 0x3f` pushes the byte 0x3f onto the stack, the stack now looks like this:
```
|Stack|
|-----|
|0x3f |
|-----|
|1    |
|-----|
```
Next instruction is `JUMPI`, standing for "Jump If", works like so:
```
jumpi(label, cond) // Jump to "label" if "cond" is true
```
In our case, `label` is 0x3f, also is where our fallback function lives in our smart contract. The `cond` argument is 1, which is result from `LT`instruction earlier. Putting this entire sequence into words, the contract jumps to the fallback function if the transaction data is less than 4 bytes.

At 0x3f, only a `STOP` function follows, since although we declared a fallback function, we keep it empty. So fallback was not implemented, our contract throws an exception instead.
![JUMPI instruction leading to fallback function](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/raw/develop/images/Faucet_jumpi_instruction.png)
Let's see the central block of the dispatcher. 

Assuming we received calldata that was > 4bytes, the `JUMPI` instruction would proceed to the following instructions:

```
PUSH1 0x0
CALLDATALOAD
PUSH29 0x1000000...
SWAP1
DIV
PUSH4 0xffffffff
AND
DUP1
PUSH4 0x2e1a7d4d
EQ
PUSH1 0x41
JUMPI
```
`PUSH1 0x0` pushes 0 onto the stack, which is currently otherwise empty. `CALLDATALOAD` accepts an index as an argument within the `calldata` sent to the smart contract and reads 32 bytes from that index, like so:
```
calldataload(p) //load 32 bytes of calldata starting from byte position p
```
Since 0 was the index passed to it from the `PUSH1`0x0 command, `CALLDATALOAD` reads 32 bytes of calldata starting at byte 0, then pushes it to the top of the stack (after popping the original 0x0). After the `PUSH29 0x100000...` instruction, the stack is then:

```
Stack
-----
0x1000000...(29 bytes long)
-------------
<32 bytes of calldata starting at byte 0>
-------------
```
`SWAP1` switches the top element on the stack with the i-th element after it, in this case it swaps 0x10000000... with the calldata, new stack is now:

```
Stack
------------
<32 bytes of calldata starting at byte 0>
----------------------
0x1000000...(29 bytes long)
----------------------------
```
Next instruction is `DIV` works as follows:
```
div(x,y) // integer division x / y
```
X is `32 bytes of calldata starting at byte 0` and Y is `0x100000... (29 bytes total)` . Dispatcher is doing the division since the `0x10000...` we pushed earlier was 29 bytes long, beginning with 1 followed by all 0s. Dividing our 32 byte calldata by this would leave us with the topmost 4 bytes of our calldata load, starting at index 0. These 4 bytes-- the first 4 bytes in the calldata starting at index 0-- are the function identifier, and this is how the EVM extracts the first 4 bytes.

Legit just 1234000 / 000 =1234, just in base 16.

Now our stack is:
```
Stack
-----------
<function identifier sent in data>
-----------
```
Since the `PUSH4 0xfffffffff`and `AND`instructions are redundant, ignored as the stack remains the same still. The `DUP1` duplicates the first item on the stack, which is the function identifier, next instruction `PUSH4 0x2e1a7d4d` pushes the precalculated function identifier of the `withdraw(uint256)`function onto the stack, now the stack is:

```
Stack
-------------
0x2e1a7d4d
---------------
<function identifier sent in data>
-----------
<function identifier sent in data>
-----------
```
Next instruction `EQ` pops the top 2 items of the stack and compares them. This is where the dispatcher does its main job: comparing whether the function identifier sent in the `msg.data` field of the transaction matches that of `withdraw(uint256)`, if equal, `EQ`pushes 1 to the stack, resulting a jump to the withdraw function, otherwise if not equal it pushes 0 onto the stack.

If transaction successful where function identifier of msg.data = function identifer of withdraw(uint256), stack is this:

```
Stack
-------------------
1
------------------
<function identifier sent in data> (aka 0x2e1a7d4d)
```
Next we have `PUSH1 0x41` which is the address at which the `withdraw(uint256)`function lives in the contract. After this, the stack looks like this:

```
Stack
-----------
0x41
-----------
1
-----------
<function identifier sent in msg.data>
```
The `JUMPI` instruction is next, and it once again accepts the top 2 elements on the stack as arguments. In this case, we have `jumpi(0x41, 1)`, which tells the EVM to execute the jump to the location of the `withdraw(uint256)` function, and the execution of that function's code can proceed.

## Turing Completeness and Gas
To prevent an execution from halting the EVM, we have gas prices, in particular "Block Gas Limit", which limits the maximum amount of gas paid, if the execution takes too long, and the gas price is too high, the transaction is halted, and the EVM moves on to the next transaction.

## Gas
From the Ethereum Yellow Paper:
-   Adding two numbers costs 3 gas
-   Calculating a Keccak-256 hash costs 30 gas + 6 gas for each 256 bits of data being hashed
-   Sending a transaction costs 21,000 gas

## Gas Accounting During Execution
When an EVM is needed to complete transaction, in the first instance it's given a gas supply equal to the amount specified by the `gas limit` in the transaction. 

Every opcode executed costs gas, thus the EVM's gas supply is reduced as the EVM steps through the program. Before each operation the EVM checks if there is enough gas to pay for the execution, if not enough, execution is halted and transaction is reverted.

If the execution is successful till the end, without running out of gas, gas cost is then paid to the miner as a transaction fee, converted to ether based on gas price specified in the transaction:
```
miner fee = gas cost * gas price
```
Gas remaining in the gas supply is refunded, again converted to ether:
```
remaining gas = gas limit - gas cost
refunded ether = remaining gas * gas price
```
If transaction "runs out of gas" during execution, transaction reverted, all changes to state rolled back, sender will be charged a transactional fee since miners already performed the computational work up to that point.

## Gas Accounting Considerations
The relative gas costs of the various operations that can be performed by the EVM have been carefully chosen to best protect the Ethereum blockchain from attack.

More computationally intensive operations cost more gas. For example, executing the `SHA3` function is 10 times more expensive (30 gas) than the ADD `operation` (3 gas). More importantly, some operations, such as `EXP`, require an additional payment based on the size of the operand. There is also a gas cost to using EVM memory and for storing data in a contract’s on-chain storage.

The importance of matching gas cost to the real-world cost of resources was demonstrated in 2016 when an attacker found and exploited a mismatch in costs. The attack generated transactions that were very computationally expensive, and made the Ethereum mainnet almost grind to a halt. This mismatch was resolved by a hard fork (codenamed `"Tangerine Whistle"`) that tweaked the relative gas costs.

## Gas Cost VS Gas Price
`Gas Cost` is the measure of computation and storage used in the EVM, gas itself also has a `price` measured in ether. During a transaction, the sender specifies the `gas price` they are willing to pay(in ether) for each unit of gas, allowing the market to decide the relationship between the price of ether and the cost of computing operations measured in gas.

```
transaction fee = total gas used * gas price paid (in ether)
```
When constructing a new block, miners on the Ethereum network can choose among pending transactions by selecting those that offer to pay a higher gas price, higher gas price = faster confirmation on transactions.

In practice, sender of a transaction sets a `gas limit` thats >= to the amount of gas expected to be used. If `gas limit` is higher than consumed, sender gets refunded. Miners only get conpensated for the work they actually perform.

`Gas Cost` = number of units of gas required to perform a particular operation
`Gas Price` = amount of ether willing to be paid per unit of gas when we send our transation to the Ethereum network

##### Negative Gas Costs
Ethereum recommends the deletion of used storage variables and accounts by refunding some of the gas used during contract execution.

2 operations in EVM with negative gas costs:
- Deleting a contract `SELFDESTRUCT` is worth a refund of 24,000 gas
- Changing a storage address from nonzero value to zero (SSTORE[x] = 0) is worth a refund of 15,000 gas.

Max refund is set to half the total amount of gas used (rounded down) to avoid abuse.

##### Block Gas Limits
Maximum amount of gas that may be consumed by all transactions in a block, limits amount of transactions that can fit into a block.

IE, we have 5 transactions whose gas limits are set to 30,000, 30,000, 40,000, 50,000, and 50,000, then any 4 of these can fit in a block, the 5th one has to wait for a future block. Miners decide, so we have different combinations since they receive transactions from the network in a different order.

If a miner attempts to include a transaction requiring more gas than the current `block gas limit`, block will be rejected from the network, thus the Ethereum clients stop you from issuing it by giving a warning like "transaction exceeds block gas limit." The block gas limit on the Ethereum mainet is `8 milion` gas at the time according to [https://etherscan.io](https://etherscan.io/), meaning that around 380 basic transactions (each consuming 21,000 gas) could fit into a block.

###### Who decides the block gas limit
Miners collectively. Individuals using a mining program, like Ethminer, connects to a Geth or Parity Ethereum client. Has a built in mechanism where miners vote on the gas limit so capacity can be increased or decreased in subsequent blocks.
