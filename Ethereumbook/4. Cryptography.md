## Key and Addresses
Private keys is the heart of all user's interaction with Ethereum.

It's not used directly in the Ethereum system, never transmitted or stored on Ethereum.

Accessing funds is achieved via digital signatures, created using the private key.

Private keys are rarely even shown to the owner. and the public key derives from the private key.

## Key Cryptography and Crytocurrency
Public key cryptography is one-way, asymmetric, easy to calculate, hard to calculate their inverse.

Like `Prime Factorization` , where we get the number 8,018,009 it's hard to know which 2 primes it was the product of.

But if we know some secrets, like 1 of the prime numbers, but then if falls under `trapdoor functions`.

More advanced functions in cryptography are based on arithmetric operations on an elliptic curve. These multiplication is simple but finding the inverse is practically impossible, aka `discrete logarithm problem` with no known trapdoors. 

Thus this `Elliptic curve cryptography` is used in modern computer systems and is the basis of Ethereum and other crypto's use of private keys and digital signatures.

Private Keys are also the unique piece of info to create `digital signatures`, required to sign transactions to spend any funds in the account and authenticate owners or users of contracts.

Public keys are a point on the elliptic curve, 2 numbers (x and y) joined together.

## Ethereum Addresses
The ETH address is derived from the last 20 bytes of the Keccak-256 Hash of the public key.

ICAP is an ETH address encoding partly compatible with IBAN encoding.
