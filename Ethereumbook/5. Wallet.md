## Wallet Technology
First type is `nondeterministic` wallets where each key is independantly generated from a different random number. Also known as `JBOK` wallet, for "Just a Bunch of Keys."

2nd type is `deterministic` wallets, where all keys are derived from a single master key, or known as seed. Common derivation uses a tree-like structure, as described in [Hierarchical Deterministic Wallets (BIP-32/BIP-44)](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook/blob/develop/05wallets.asciidoc#hd_wallets).

## Wallet Best Practices
Common standards are:
- Mnemonic code words, based on BIP-39
- HD wallets, based on BIP-32
- Multipurpose HD wallet structure, based on BIP-43
- Multicurrency and multiaccount wallets, based on BIP-44
